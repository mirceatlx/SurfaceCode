Experiments:


Simulator:
1. Initialize and measure logical qubit: 
  - add noise between cycles (measure error rates)
  - compare the two ways of iniialization and measurement (error rates)

2. Single bit-flip operations logical qubit:
  - add noise between cycles (measure error rates)
  - compare the two ways of iniialization and measurement (error rates)
  - (run on general simulator with real noise)

3. Two qubit operations logical qubit:
  - add noise between cycles (measure error rates)
  - compare the two ways of iniialization and measurement (error rates)



Real:
1. Let Qiskit tranpile the circuit to make it compatible with IBM platform
  - 1, 2 (measure error rates) and compare with simulator



Potential experiments:
- Quantum error correction cyle - logical error prob.
- Code distance d  - Logical error rate per cycle
